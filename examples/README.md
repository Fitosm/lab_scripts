# Example assets

This folder stores sample files students can copy into a local working folder alongside their own EEG data.

- `rename_channels.example.tsv`: two-column template for mapping raw channel names to standardized names; make a copy named `rename_channels.tsv` before running the script.
- `est13yo.edf`: curated demo EDF for testing the pipeline (keep tracked only if size policy allows).
